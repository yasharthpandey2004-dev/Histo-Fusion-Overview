> **Histo-Fusion (Spatial Omics Analysis Pipeline)**
> * Developed a modular 19-stage computational pipeline in **Python** to process and analyze spatial transcriptomics data.
> * Implemented a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** architecture (using PyTorch Geometric) to model spatial cellular neighborhoods and predict ligand-receptor interactions.
> * Built custom preprocessing scripts for HuBMAP datasets, including spatial alignment and synthetic data simulation.
> * Engineered an automated CLI (`histofusion_cli.py`) to orchestrate data loading, model training, and downstream biological annotation.
